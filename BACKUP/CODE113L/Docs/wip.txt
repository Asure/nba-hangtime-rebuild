This is hangtime 1.3
--- NOTE ---
Thing changed now we have 710K conventional in dosbox.
But some asm files with IMGTBL.GLO are still too big.
Don't rebuild the .AXX files for now!
------------------------------------------------------

default imgtbl.asm and imgtbl.glo come from misc it seems.

PAL.AXX
	.include	"plyrhd6.tbl" bb8
	.include	"plyrhd6.glo" bb8
	.include	"imgpal8.asm" bb8 -> bat nukes imgtbl.glo
	.include	"mugshot.tbl" bb7
	.include	"mugshot.glo" bb7

BGNDTBL.AXX and several others, from misc..

IMGPAL2.ASM -> from bb2
IMGPAL7.ASM -> from bb7



BB.AXX
	.include	"credturb.tbl" ? from bb7
	.include	"credturb.glo" ? from bb7

	.include	"hoop.tbl"  ? from bb7
	.include	"hoop.glo" ? from bb7

	.include	"outdoor.glo"  ? from bb7
	.include	"imgtbl.glo" which one?
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" which one? bat file implies BB2
	.include	"imgtblp.glo" which one? bat file implies BBPAL

BB3.AXX
	.include	"crowd.tbl" ? bb2
	.include	"courtflr.tbl" ? bb7

	.include	"cheer.tbl" ? bb6
	.include	"court.tbl" ? bbmisc
	.include	"outdoor.tbl" ? bb7
	.include	"outdoor.glo" ? bb7

	.include	"imgtbl.glo" the default one from bbmisc i guess
	.include	"hoop.glo" bb7

PLYR.AXX
	.include	"imgtbl.glo" the default one from bbmisc i guess
	.include	"imgtbl7.glo" bb7 
	.include	"credturb.glo" bb7
-out-of-memory- Including plyr.glo, hope it works.

PLYR2.axx
is ok

plyrhd.tbl comes from BB

PLYRAT.AXX - wants a lot.
	.include	"imgtblp.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl1.glo" ? bb
	.include	"imgtblm.glo" ? bbmug
	.include	"plyrhd6.glo" ? bb8
	.include	"plyrhd6a.glo" ? bb6

plyrseq.tbl comes from bb2

PLYRSEQ.AXX
	.include	"plyrseq.glo" ? bb2
	.include	"plyrseq3.glo" ? bb5
	.include	"behind.tbl" ? bb3
	.include	"plyrdsp.tbl" ? bb5
	.include	"plyrjsht.tbl" ? bb5
	.include	"dunks.glo" ? bb5
-out-of-memory- commented imgtbl.glo, builds
	
text.axx: imgtbl.glo too large, commented it.. hrm.

plyr3.axx

attract.axx
	used 7.* and imgtbl7.glo
select.axx
	used imgpalm.asm, edited to imgpalm.glo inc.
compiled outside of NC
select2.axx
 almost builds. imgtbl.glo again. used select2.glo






===========================================================
This is where we look at MK2 and NBA JAM TE

IMGTBL.ASM -  	.include imgtbl.glo , 	.include bgndtbl.glo, that's all.

IMGTBL.GLO - 235 globals.
IMGTBL2 - IMGTBL7.GLO, loose files. All the content is together in IMGTBL.GLO. Nothing references these .glo files at any point.

IMGPAL2.ASM - IMGPAL7.ASM, loose files. All .include IMGTBL.GLO

MK2:
NO IMAGES ARE IN IMGTBL.GLO
ONLY PALs are in IMGTBL.GLO

BB.AXX

	.include	"imgtbl.glo"  ? Was included in src. Probably from BB.LOD?
	.include	"imgtblp.glo" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" ? from bb2.lod (uncertain)
	.include	"imgpalp.asm" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgpal2.asm" ? from bb2.lod (certain)

PLYR.AXX 
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo" ? from bb2.lod (uncertain)

PLYRAT.AXX
	.include	"imgpalp.asm" ? from bbpal.lod
	.include	"imgpal3.asm" ? from bb3.lod (guess! YES)
	.include	"imgtbl4.glo" ? from bb3.lod
	.include	"plyrhd4.tbl" ? from bb3.lod

PLYR3.AXX
	.include	"imgtbl.glo"
	.include	"imgtbl2.glo"
	.include	"bgndtbl.glo"

	.include	"plyrhd2.tbl"
	.include	"imgtblm.glo" ? from BBMUG?
	.include	"imgtbl3.glo" ? from BBMUG?
	.include	"plyrhd3.tbl"

obj's compiled, symbol ref errors.
Easy first. DIAGP in TEST.OBJ
	.include	"imgtbl.glo" does it have DIAGP? Why not?
- it does not have DIAGP
- DIAGP: not in BB.LOD. it is in IMGPAL.ASM from BB2.LOD
- IMGPAL2.ASM is not build as OBJ. Lets do that. And include imgtbl2.glo.
This solves TEST.OBJ!
---
Harder second. SELECT2.OBJ lots. Focus on.. BUTT_P - in IMGTBL.GLO from BB.LOD and in IMGTBL.ASM.
Needed to replace mostly blank IMGTBL.ASM, see .bak
lots of bmod. BGNDTBL.ASM was fudged from the start for some reason.
---
score.obj
arwbp
IMGPAL.ASM from BB.LOD used.
clean broke BGNDPAL
replace from BB.LOD
