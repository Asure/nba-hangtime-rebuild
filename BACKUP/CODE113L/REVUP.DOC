Here is the list of the changes from NBA Hangtime version L1.2 to
version L1.3:

  1) Free full-game on power-up for players 1 & 2 bugfix;
     produced if a player pressed a start button within the first
     8 ticks (1/7 second) of entry to Attract mode following power-up
     Version screen; then, while still on Credits screen, player
     would drop enough to start a game, thereby allowing players 1 & 2
     to press start for a free full-game
