Notes on Hangtime work.
-----------------------

22-05-2023 Notes started.

Todo:
- Fix images /lod etc. write a bat file.
- preasm.exe replacement.. :(

Findings:
arc/D3.asm seems to hold battlezone game?
robo.asm is robotron. Seems they wanted to include this at some point. Same with WWF, it never got included?
SRC seems to be Max Hangtime l1/m1 1.0, not sure yet.
util.asm seems to hold both JAM and TE security tables (#sec_t). (usefull if we want to hack TE to run on Jam boards and vice versa.)

assembling diag.asm: Seems to be OK, after fixer python :)
assembling unzip.asm

     156 00000090     cbf6          jrnz    p2
 *********  AN IDENTIFIER IN THE EXPRESSION IS INVALID

     158                    #p2
 *********  ILLEGAL LABEL

- They have labels starting with # in the code.
- They have labels starting with # that are duplicates
- They have routines like jrnz #label. 
- But sometimes they don't use the #label in the jrnz or djsj.. mweh
- The GSPA assembler does not like jrnz #label thing.
- The GSPA assembler does not like #label as a start of a routine.

looking at mk3's unzip.asm 'blowline' routine
- routines with SUBR
- routine name has SUBRP in front of it (.even)
- #lp got changed to lp7

Examples of stupid misuse of labels and no-labels.

 SUBRP  movie_waitdma

jrge	#wtlp
jrn	wtlp

#chklp	move	*a8+,a1
	add	a1,a2
	dsj	a0,chklp  <- no leading #
